# Phase Context Template

Template for `.planning/phases/XX-name/{phase_num}-CONTEXT.md` - captures implementation decisions for a phase.

**Purpose:** Document decisions that downstream agents need. Researcher uses this to know WHAT to investigate. Planner uses this to know WHAT choices are locked vs flexible.

**Key principle:** Categories are NOT predefined. They emerge from what was actually discussed for THIS phase. A CLI phase has CLI-relevant sections, a UI phase has UI-relevant sections.

**Downstream consumers:**
- `forge-phase-researcher` — Reads decisions to focus research (e.g., "card layout" → research card component patterns)
- `forge-planner` — Reads decisions to create specific tasks (e.g., "infinite scroll" → task includes virtualization)

## File Template

```markdown
# Phase [X]: [Name] - Context

**Gathered:** [date]
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

[Clear statement of what this phase delivers — the scope anchor. This comes from ROADMAP.md and is fixed. Discussion clarifies implementation within this boundary.]

</domain>

<upstream>
## Upstream Decisions

[Decisions already made in PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, or phase research — carried forward, not re-asked during discussion. Each includes source for traceability.]

- [Decision] (source: REQ-XXX / PROJECT.md / RESEARCH.md)

[If none: omit this section entirely]

</upstream>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

### [Area 1 that was discussed]
- [Specific decision made]
- [Another decision if applicable]

### [Area 2 that was discussed]
- [Specific decision made]

### Codebase-Informed
[Decisions where user selected "Use Codebase Explorer" — decided based on codebase
analysis via the CCE API. Includes evidence so downstream agents (researcher, planner)
understand the rationale and can verify against the actual code.]
- [Decision] — [evidence summary] *(via Codebase Explorer)*

[If no CCE-informed decisions were made: omit this section]

### Claude's Discretion
[Areas where user explicitly said "you decide" — Claude has flexibility here during planning/implementation]

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

[Any particular references, examples, or "I want it like X" moments from discussion. Product references, specific behaviors, interaction patterns.]

[If none: "No specific requirements — open to standard approaches"]

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

[Ideas that came up during discussion but belong in other phases. Captured here so they're not lost, but explicitly out of scope for this phase.]

[If none: "None — discussion stayed within phase scope"]

</deferred>

**Example 1: Visual feature (Post Feed)**

```markdown
# Phase 3: Post Feed - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-01-20
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Display posts from followed users in a scrollable feed. Users can view posts and see engagement counts. Creating posts and interactions are separate phases.

</domain>

<upstream>
## Upstream Decisions

- Card-based layout (source: REQ-007 — "Posts displayed as cards with author, timestamp, content")
- Infinite scroll loading (source: REQ-007 acceptance criteria — "Feed loads continuously on scroll")

</upstream>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

### Card detail
- Each card shows: author avatar, name, timestamp, full post content, reaction counts
- Cards have subtle shadows, rounded corners — modern feel

### Loading behavior
- Pull-to-refresh on mobile
- New posts indicator at top ("3 new posts") rather than auto-inserting

### Empty state
- Friendly illustration + "Follow people to see posts here"
- Suggest 3-5 accounts to follow based on interests

### Claude's Discretion
- Loading skeleton design
- Exact spacing and typography
- Error state handling

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- "I like how Twitter shows the new posts indicator without disrupting your scroll position"
- Cards should feel like Linear's issue cards — clean, not cluttered

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Commenting on posts — Phase 5
- Bookmarking posts — add to backlog

</deferred>

<guidelines>
**This template captures DECISIONS for downstream agents.**

The output should answer: "What does the researcher need to investigate? What choices are locked for the planner?"

**Good content (concrete decisions):**
- "Card-based layout, not timeline"
- "Retry 3 times on network failure, then fail"
- "Group by year, then by month"
- "JSON for programmatic use, table for humans"

**Bad content (too vague):**
- "Should feel modern and clean"
- "Good user experience"
- "Fast and responsive"
- "Easy to use"

**After creation:**
- File lives in phase directory: `.planning/phases/XX-name/{phase_num}-CONTEXT.md`
- `forge-phase-researcher` uses decisions to focus investigation
- `forge-planner` uses decisions + research to create executable tasks
- Downstream agents should NOT need to ask the user again about captured decisions
</guidelines>
